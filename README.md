# 3D semantic mapping

Supporting code for the project semantic 3D reconstruction in simulated and real environments and remote semantic label transfer. 

The majority of the pipeline can be found under the [kimera_ws](https://github.com/RozDavid/semantic_mapping/tree/master/kimera_ws) directory, supporting scripts in the [scripts](https://github.com/RozDavid/semantic_mapping/tree/master/scripts) folder, the simulation environment in [habitat](https://github.com/RozDavid/semantic_mapping/tree/master/habitat) and finally semantic segmentation related nodes are in the [semantic_segmentation](https://github.com/RozDavid/semantic_mapping/tree/master/semantic_segmentation) folder. 

Additional README-s and installation/execution descriptions can be found in the corresponding folders.
